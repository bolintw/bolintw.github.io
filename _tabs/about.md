Hi, I'm Bo Lin. I'm a Taiwan-based software engineer with a deep passion for the intersection of hardware and software. By day, I work as a normal software engineer; by night, I design, build, and debug my own electronics projects.

My journey into tech was sparked by a fascination with robotics, which built my foundation in embedded systems. For the past few years, I've been diving deep into the world of large-scale, low-level systems. This blog is where I bridge those two worlds—applying rigorous engineering principles to the creative, hands-on projects I'm passionate about.

### About This Blog

This site serves as my technical journal and a **"dynamic resume."** Instead of just *telling* you what I can do, I'd rather *show* you the process.

You won't find a polished list of finished projects here. Instead, this blog is my personal notebook—a collection of technical memos, debugging stories, and discoveries I find worth recording during the development cycle. It's a candid look at the challenges, the solutions, and the 'a-ha!' moments that often happen at 2 AM.

My hope is that by sharing my development experiences, you'll find something useful, insightful, or at least relatable for your own journey.

### The 'Struggling SWE' Philosophy

My online handle, "Struggling SWE" (Software Engineer), comes from a simple belief: **the more you learn, the more you realize you don't know.**

This blog is an honest account of that struggle. It's not a collection of perfect, finished projects; it's a journal of the entire process—the bugs, the "why-is-this-stuck" moments, and the satisfaction of finally finding a solution. If that sounds like your journey, you're in the right place.

### Let's Connect

I'm always open to connecting with fellow engineers, makers, and potential collaborators. You can find me on the platforms listed in the sidebar, or see the code for this blog (and my other projects) directly on [GitHub](httpss://github.com/bolintw) or mail to k2345777@gmail.com.
